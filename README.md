# Predictive-Factors-Analysis---Cancer-Severity

This repository has all the required files and data for this project.


Background:
With the advent of technology, medical datasets have become more comprehensive and allow for deeper insights into factors indicating and
influencing diseases. Cancer is one such disease, which is lethal in its later stages. Indicators of the severity (malignant or benign)
of any tumors would be crucial for initial prognosis. This project revolves around utilizing data analysis techniques to discern patterns
and correlations within a dataset pertaining to tumor features and their severity. The main endeavour of this project is to contribute to
the understanding of tumor features, cancer progression dynamics, and potentially aiding in early detection and treatment strategies.


Project Objective:
1. Answer 3 initial questions:
- Which of the listed features are the strongest indicators of cancer severity, based on visual explorations?  
- Which features show strong correlations with each other, and how might these correlations differ between benign and malignant cancer.  
- How do the size-related features (radius, perimeter, area) correlate with the severity (malignant status) of the tumors?  
2. Utilize linear models and scatterplots to derive additional correlations between features and severity.


Significance:
The significance of this project lies in its potential to add to our undertsanding of cancer indicators and progression factors. Identifying 
strong indicators of cancer severity could facilitate earlier diagnoses and interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Moreover, 
uncovering correlations between different features and discerning how they differ between benign and malignant cases could enhance predictive models, 
offering more personalized and precise treatment approaches. Furthermore, exploring the relationship between size-related features and tumor severity 
could unveil underlying physiological mechanisms driving cancer progression. Ultimately, the insights gleaned from this project have the potential 
to inform clinical decision-making, contributing to advancements in cancer research and patient care.

  (c) Collection Method
  - Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/
  - Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, “Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming.” Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.
  - The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: “Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets”, Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
